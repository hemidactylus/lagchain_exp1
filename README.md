# LangChain experiments

With the goal of providing Cassandra / Astra DB support in the form of

## Phase I - LLM caching

See [this page](phase1_llmcaching.md).

## Phase II - CQLChain

See [this page](phase2_cqlchain.md).

## Phase III - Memory

See [this page](phase3_memory.md)

## Phase IV - Agents
